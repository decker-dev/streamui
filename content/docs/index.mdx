description: Open source streaming UI components for AI applications. Built for the community.

streamui is an open collection of streaming UI components for React, designed to work seamlessly with AI SDK 6. The goal is simple: **help you build beautiful progressive UIs for AI applications**.

This is my small contribution to the open source community that taught me so much. {'<3'}

## Not a library—an open component distribution

Like shadcn/ui, streamui is not a typical install-from-NPM library. It's an open collection you can copy, modify, and customize directly in your codebase. You own the code. No wrappers, no overrides, no fighting with the library.

Streaming UI is deceptively complex. Progressive rendering, partial data handling, loading states—each one has edge cases and design decisions that take time to get right. streamui gives you battle-tested starting points so you can focus on what makes your product unique.

## Why streamui?

- **Open source & copy-first**: Direct access to source so you can adapt components to your design system
- **AI SDK 6 compatible**: Built for `Output.object()` and structured streaming
- **Schema-first**: Zod schemas that work with both AI SDK and component validation
- **Progressive rendering**: Components update smoothly as data streams in
- **shadcn compatible**: Install via the shadcn CLI, works with your existing setup
- **Accessible**: Built with semantic HTML and accessibility in mind
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with exported types

## Getting Started

Install your first streaming component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://streamui.dev/r/weather-card.json"
```

Then use it with AI SDK:

```tsx
import { experimental_useObject as useObject } from "@ai-sdk/react";
import { WeatherCard, weatherCardSchema } from "@/components/stream/weather-card";

export function WeatherDemo() {
  const { object, submit, isLoading } = useObject({
    api: "/api/weather",
    schema: weatherCardSchema,
  });

  return (
    <WeatherCard 
      data={object ?? undefined} 
      isLoading={isLoading && !object} 
    />
  );
}
```
