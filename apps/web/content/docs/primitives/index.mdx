description: Primitives for building streaming UI with React.
---

The `@stream.ui/react` package provides primitives for handling partial/streaming data in React applications.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stream.ui/react
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { Stream } from "@stream.ui/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { object, isLoading, error } = useObject({ ... });

  return (
    <Stream.Root data={object} isLoading={isLoading} error={error}>
      <Stream.Field path="title" fallback={<Skeleton />}>
        {(title) => <h1>{title}</h1>}
      </Stream.Field>
      
      <Stream.List path="items" fallback={<ItemsSkeleton />}>
        {(items) => items.map(item => <Item key={item.id} {...item} />)}
      </Stream.List>
      
      <Stream.When loading>
        <Spinner />
      </Stream.When>
      
      <Stream.When error>
        {(err) => <ErrorMessage error={err} />}
      </Stream.When>
    </Stream.Root>
  );
}
```

## Primitives

| Primitive | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`Stream.Root`](/docs/primitives/stream-root) | Provides context with streaming data and state |
| [`Stream.Field`](/docs/primitives/stream-field) | Accesses a field by path with automatic fallback |
| [`Stream.List`](/docs/primitives/stream-list) | Renders arrays that grow as data streams in |
| [`Stream.When`](/docs/primitives/stream-when) | Conditionally renders based on stream state |

## How It Works

When you use `useObject` from AI SDK, data arrives incrementally:

```
t=0: undefined
t=1: { title: "Hello" }
t=2: { title: "Hello", items: [] }
t=3: { title: "Hello", items: [{ id: 1 }] }
t=4: { title: "Hello", items: [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }] }
...
```

The primitives handle this automatically:

1. **Stream.Root** tracks the state (loading → streaming → complete)
2. **Stream.Field** shows fallback until the field exists
3. **Stream.List** renders items as they arrive
4. **Stream.When** shows different UI based on state

## States

| State | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `idle` | No data, not loading |
| `loading` | Loading, no data yet |
| `streaming` | Loading, partial data exists |
| `complete` | Not loading, data exists |
| `error` | An error occurred |
